# Data-Science-with-Python


Employment Stats(Jupyter Notbook): The data consisted of records of people ranging from 2005-2012 and the time spent on various activities in a day along with their gender, earnings, education level and employment status. I ran some descriptive stats on the data producing some useful insights about the data and ran a random forest algorithm with 94% accuracy which I validated using confusion matrix. This was my analysis in a data analytics competition in my college.

Project: This file contains my first time series analysis on Tesla's stock prices from 2014-2018. I implemented ARIMA model to predict the confusion interval for stock prices in the future.
